# Control Flow Example

**What:** Learn how to make decisions and repeat actions in Rust.

**Why:** Every program needs to do different things based on conditions and repeat tasks. This example shows how.

## What This Example Shows

- **if/else statements**: "If this is true, do this; otherwise, do that"
- **while loops**: "Keep repeating until this condition becomes false"
- **for loops**: "Repeat for each item in a collection"
- **loop with break**: "Repeat forever until I tell you to stop"
- **match statements**: "Check this value against several options and pick the right one"

## Run It

```bash
cargo run
```

You'll see output showing different control flow patterns in action.

## Why This Matters

- **if/else** lets your program make decisions
- **loops** save you from writing repetitive code
- **match** is safer than other languages' switch statements (Rust makes sure you handle all cases)

## Beginner's Explanation

Think of control flow like giving directions:
- **if/else**: "If it's raining, bring an umbrella; else, wear sunscreen"
- **while loop**: "While you're hungry, keep eating"
- **for loop**: "For each item in your shopping list, buy it"
- **match**: "Check the traffic light: if red STOP, if yellow SLOW, if green GO"
