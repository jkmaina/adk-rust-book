# Control Flow Example

Learn how Rust handles conditionals, loops, and control flow.

## What This Example Shows

- **if/else statements**: Conditional execution
- **loop**: Infinite loop with `break`
- **while loops**: Repeating until a condition is false
- **for loops**: Iterating over collections
- **loop with return value**: Breaking out with a computed value
- **match statements**: Pattern matching over values

## Run It

```bash
cargo run
```

## Key Concepts

- Rust's `if`, `while`, and `for` are expressions (they return values)
- `break` and `continue` control loop flow
- `match` is more powerful than switch statements—it's pattern matching
